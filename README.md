### Docker instalation
  1.  To install docker follow the below mentioned steps.
      1.  [Set up the repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository:~:text=from%20the%20repository.-,Set%20up%20the%20repository,-Update%20the%20apt)
      2.  [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#:~:text=/dev/null-,Install%20Docker%20Engine,-Update%20the%20apt)
  2. Configure docker to run without sudo.
     1. [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
  3. Install Docker-compose by running the follwing command:
      - The following command will download the 2.16.0 release and save the executable file at /usr/local/bin/docker-compose, which will make this software globally accessible as docker-compose:
         ```
         sudo curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
         ```
      - Set the correct permissions so that the docker-compose command is executable:
         ```
         sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
         ```
      - To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:
         ```
         docker-compose --version
         ```
         Youâ€™ll see output similar to this:
         ```
         Output
         docker-compose version 2.16.0, build 5becea4c
         ```
         Docker Compose is now successfully installed on your system.
  
  4. Download the follwing docker images to your local machine  

     -   ```
         docker pull postgres:14-alpine
         ```
         - Verify the image
            ```
            docker run --rm -ti postgres:14-alpine  psql -V
            ```
            Output: **psql (PostgreSQL) 14.5**
